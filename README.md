![Final Product](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/1tObED6272dFbDttCjIH2er_hwBorrNYWwsK7UB6ud--1Bd3Mkt1hdwirR_mKKj6_Ym1NWEzBPBi8Ih-6dqZ=w1920-h974-rw)

Uses the RogueSharp library (https://roguesharp.wordpress.com/),Stone and dirt textures from Skorpio at OpenGameArt.org (https://opengameart.org/content/3d-dungeon-tileset), Wood texture for door from West at OpenGameArt.org (https://opengameart.org/content/wall-grass-rock-stone-wood-and-dirt-480)

The game doesn't have any enemies currently, but has working player FOV, grass and door animations, and generates the map as player explores.
