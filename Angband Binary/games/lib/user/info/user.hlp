lib/user/info
=============

This directory contains the framework for reading user-created help files.
It currently only contains this menu file, and a dummy help file to show how
to add new ones.  You can add whatever text files you like here, and access
them from the last entry in the main help menu.

    (a) Dummy file             (dummy.txt)
